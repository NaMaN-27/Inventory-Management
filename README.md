# Inventory-Management
The basic working of the project is based on querying the database depending on the user input provided. But before we can query database we need to connect to the database . The program quits if it fails to connect to the database . Then, after querying the database  the data fetched from the database is then displayed to the user . The data fetched from the database is in  format of rows .From the rows we can extract individual fields as per our need . 

The user can also choose to save the data in the .csv file for further use. For this file handling capabilities of C++ have been used and the data Is written to file in csv format .
